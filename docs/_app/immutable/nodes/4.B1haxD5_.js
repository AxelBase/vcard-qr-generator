Yet vCard QR codes — plain text, static, 30-year-old technology — continue to dominate professional contact sharing. Why?</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Cross-Platform Compatibility Wins</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Every modern smartphone — iOS 11+, Android 9+, even feature phones with cameras — can scan a QR code and instantly import a vCard. No app required. No account needed. No permissions beyond camera access.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">NFC? Only works on devices with NFC chips (are still less than 90% globally). Wallet passes? iOS and Android use incompatible formats. Link-in-bio pages? Require internet and often break in messaging apps.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Zero Dependency, Maximum Reliability</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">A vCard QR code is just text. No external hosting. No CDN. No JavaScript. No tracking pixels. If the QR image exists, the contact works — forever.</p> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">Compare that to a link shortening service going down, a domain expiring, or a SaaS platform shutting down. Your QR code printed in 2025 will still work in 2045.</p> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Payload Efficiency and Scanner Tolerance</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">A well-optimized vCard 3.0 payload is typically 350–600 bytes. Even with High error correction (30% damage tolerance), this fits comfortably in a Version 7 QR code — well within the capabilities of every scanner app.</p> <h3 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Real-World Adoption (2025)</h3> <ul class="svelte-1tq17n3"><li class="svelte-1tq17n3">LinkedIn: QR code sharing built-in</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Apple Contacts: Native QR scanning since iOS 11</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Google Lens: Instant vCard import</li> <li class="svelte-1tq17n3">Business cards: 68% now include QR codes (up from 12% in 2019)</li></ul> <h2 class="svelte-1tq17n3">Conclusion</h2> <p class="svelte-1tq17n3">QR codes aren’t flashy. They’re not “Web3”. They don’t require blockchain or AI. But they work everywhere, forever, without permission. That’s why, in 2025, the humble vCard QR code remains the most universal, reliable, and future-proof way to share contact information.</p> <p class="italic-note svelte-1tq17n3">The simplest technology often wins — because it just works.</p></article></div>');function x(d){var e=C();g("1tq17n3",h=>{var s=w(),v=y(u(s),6);t(4),i(()=>r(v,"content",`${c??""}/blog/posts/post1`)),f(()=>{b.title="Why QR Codes Remain the Universal Contact Standard in 2025"}),n(h,s)});var a=o(e),m=o(a);t(4),l(a),t(2),l(e),i(()=>r(m,"href",`${c??""}/blog`)),n(d,e)}export{x as component,W as universal};
